# SSL Setup Guide (After DNS Configuration)

This guide walks you through enabling HTTPS with Let's Encrypt SSL certificates after your DNS is properly configured.

## Prerequisites

âœ… DNS A record pointing your subdomain to 91.98.39.164
âœ… WordPress containers running and accessible via HTTP
âœ… Domain propagation complete (test with `nslookup blog.dscp.team`)

---

## Step 1: Update Nginx Configuration

SSH into your VPS:
```bash
ssh root@91.98.39.164
cd /opt/wordpress
```

Stop the containers:
```bash
docker compose down
```

Edit the nginx configuration:
```bash
nano nginx/conf.d/wordpress.conf
```

### Changes to make:

1. **Line 5**: Update the HTTP server_name
   ```nginx
   # Change from:
   server_name _;

   # To (replace with your actual subdomain):
   server_name blog.dscp.team;
   ```

2. **Lines 13-15**: Enable HTTPS redirect
   ```nginx
   # Uncomment these lines:
   location / {
       return 301 https://$host$request_uri;
   }
   ```

3. **Lines 17-30**: Comment out or remove the temporary HTTP location block
   ```nginx
   # Comment out or delete this section:
   # location / {
   #     fastcgi_pass wordpress:9000;
   #     ...
   # }
   ```

4. **Lines 37-72**: Uncomment the entire HTTPS server block

5. **Replace YOUR_SUBDOMAIN.dscp.team** in 3 places (lines 40, 44-46):
   ```nginx
   server_name blog.dscp.team;

   ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/fullchain.pem;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/privkey.pem;
   ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/chain.pem;
   ```

Save and exit (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter).

---

## Step 2: Start Containers (HTTP Only)

Before getting the SSL certificate, start containers with HTTP only:

```bash
# Start containers
docker compose up -d

# Verify nginx is running
docker compose ps

# Test that your domain is accessible
curl -I http://blog.dscp.team
```

You should see a 200 OK response or WordPress redirect.

---

## Step 3: Obtain SSL Certificate

Run Certbot to get your SSL certificate:

```bash
# Replace with your actual subdomain and email
docker compose run --rm certbot certonly --webroot \
  --webroot-path=/var/www/certbot \
  --email your-email@example.com \
  --agree-tos \
  --no-eff-email \
  -d blog.dscp.team
```

**Expected output:**
```
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/privkey.pem
```

If you see errors:
- **DNS errors**: Wait longer for DNS propagation
- **Connection errors**: Check firewall allows port 80
- **Domain validation fails**: Ensure nginx is serving the .well-known/acme-challenge/ path

---

## Step 4: Restart with HTTPS

Now that you have the certificates, restart to enable HTTPS:

```bash
# Restart all containers
docker compose restart

# Check logs for errors
docker compose logs nginx

# Verify HTTPS is working
curl -I https://blog.dscp.team
```

---

## Step 5: Test SSL Configuration

### Test in Browser
1. Go to https://blog.dscp.team
2. Check for padlock icon in address bar
3. Click the padlock to view certificate details
4. Verify it's issued by "Let's Encrypt"

### Test HTTP Redirect
```bash
curl -I http://blog.dscp.team
```
Should return `301 Moved Permanently` and redirect to HTTPS.

### Test SSL Grade
Go to: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=blog.dscp.team

Should get an **A** or **A+** rating.

---

## Step 6: Set Up Automatic Renewal

Let's Encrypt certificates expire after 90 days. The Certbot container is configured to auto-renew.

Test the renewal process:
```bash
# Dry run (doesn't actually renew)
docker compose run --rm certbot renew --dry-run
```

If successful, you'll see:
```
Congratulations, all simulated renewals succeeded
```

The certbot container will automatically check for renewal twice daily.

---

## Step 7: Update WordPress URLs

WordPress may still have HTTP URLs in the database. Update them:

### Option A: Via WordPress Admin (Recommended)
1. Log in to WordPress admin: https://blog.dscp.team/wp-admin
2. Go to **Settings > General**
3. Update:
   - **WordPress Address (URL)**: https://blog.dscp.team
   - **Site Address (URL)**: https://blog.dscp.team
4. Click **Save Changes**

### Option B: Via Database (if locked out)
```bash
docker compose exec mysql mysql -u wordpress_user -p wordpress

# In MySQL prompt:
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value='https://blog.dscp.team' WHERE option_name='siteurl';
UPDATE wp_options SET option_value='https://blog.dscp.team' WHERE option_name='home';
EXIT;
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Certificate not found error
```bash
# List certificates
docker compose run --rm certbot certificates

# Check certificate files exist
docker compose exec nginx ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/live/
```

### Mixed content warnings (HTTP resources on HTTPS page)
- Install "Really Simple SSL" WordPress plugin
- Or manually update theme/plugin URLs in WordPress admin

### Certificate renewal fails
```bash
# Check logs
docker compose logs certbot

# Manually renew
docker compose run --rm certbot renew --force-renewal
```

### Nginx fails to start after SSL config
```bash
# Test nginx configuration
docker compose exec nginx nginx -t

# Check for typos in wordpress.conf
nano nginx/conf.d/wordpress.conf

# View detailed nginx logs
docker compose logs nginx
```

---

## Manual Certificate Renewal

If automatic renewal fails, renew manually:

```bash
# Stop nginx (to free port 80)
docker compose stop nginx

# Renew certificate
docker compose run --rm certbot renew

# Start nginx
docker compose start nginx
```

---

## Security Best Practices

After enabling SSL:

1. âœ… Force HTTPS in WordPress settings
2. âœ… Enable HSTS header (already configured in nginx)
3. âœ… Update all internal links to HTTPS
4. âœ… Set up 301 redirects from HTTP to HTTPS (already configured)
5. âœ… Update Google Search Console with HTTPS version
6. âœ… Update any external links/bookmarks

---

## Certificate Locations

Certificates are stored in Docker volumes:

- **On host**: `./certbot/conf/live/blog.dscp.team/`
- **In container**: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/blog.dscp.team/`

Files:
- `fullchain.pem` - Full certificate chain
- `privkey.pem` - Private key
- `chain.pem` - Intermediate certificates
- `cert.pem` - Your certificate only

**Never share or commit `privkey.pem`!**

---

## Backup Certificates

Important before major changes:

```bash
# Backup certificates
cd /opt/wordpress
tar -czf certbot-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz certbot/

# Backup to another location
scp certbot-backup-*.tar.gz user@backup-server:/backups/
```

---

## Next Steps After SSL

- Configure WordPress caching plugins
- Set up CDN (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Install security plugins (Wordfence)
- Enable WordPress automatic updates
- Set up monitoring and uptime alerts

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Check certificate expiry
docker compose run --rm certbot certificates

# Force certificate renewal
docker compose run --rm certbot renew --force-renewal

# Test renewal process
docker compose run --rm certbot renew --dry-run

# View nginx error logs
docker compose logs nginx | grep error

# Restart after config changes
docker compose restart nginx

# Check SSL configuration
docker compose exec nginx nginx -t
```

---

## Support

If SSL setup fails:
1. Verify DNS is working: `nslookup blog.dscp.team`
2. Check firewall allows ports 80 and 443
3. Ensure nginx is serving .well-known/acme-challenge/
4. Review Certbot logs: `docker compose logs certbot`
5. Test nginx config: `docker compose exec nginx nginx -t`

SSL should be working! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ”’
